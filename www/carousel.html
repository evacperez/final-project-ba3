                    According to UNESCO, 61 million primary school-age children
                    were not enrolled in school in 2010. Of these children,
                    47% were never expected to enter school, 26% attended school but left,
                    and the remaining 27% are expected to attend school in the future.

                    In the sub-Saharan, 11.07 million children leave school
                    before completing their primary education. In South and West
                    Asia, that number reaches 13.54 million.

                    In developing, low-income countries, every additional year
                    of education can increase a person&#39;s future income by an
                    average of 10%.

                    Children living in a rural environment are twice as likely
                    to be out of school than urban children. Additionally,
                    children from the wealthiest 20% of the population are 4
                    times more likely to be in school than the poorest 20%.
